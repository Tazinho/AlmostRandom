# Biography

I am a business consultant at implexis analytics, where I am mainly responsible for data science applications and predictive analytics in the retail sector.

I am also a PhD candidate in the neuroradiology of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. My research interests include the application of machine learning and pattern recognition in neurosciences, where I specialize on the prediction of the outcome of patients suffering from an ischemic stroke.

Regarding the overlap of both positions, I am focussing on higher programming languages, big data technologies and analytical toolchains, leading me -- almost randomly -- into all kind of different use cases and side projects.
