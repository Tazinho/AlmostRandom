Hi, welcome on my page about my Data Science projects.

In the past, I did a lot of parallel work in industry and research. Due to the overlaps and the often similar technical requirements of the projects, I developed a general interest in higher level programming languages for dealing with data. Through this I met a lot of cool people, and every now and then we realized one or the other idea for a side project together. Some of these results can be found here on this page.
