Hi, thank you for visiting my little page about my Data Science projects.

I am working as Chief Data Scientist at  [Cronbach](https://www.cronbach.co/), where I am mainly responsible for the technological and analytical processes of the company. In addition to our contextual and psychographic targeting solution (see [here](https://www.mediaplus.com/de/news/ne-r-o-ai.html) for more info), I like to develop small tools to support our customers and consultants in the form of R-Packages or Shiny Apps. Preferably with components of machine learning as well.

Besides this job, I am about to finish my PhD thesis at the [UKE](https://www.uke.de/) about tissue outcome prediction of acute ischemic stroke patients.

In the past, I did a lot of parallel work in business and research. Due to the overlaps and the often similar technical requirements of the projects, I developed a general interest in higher level programming languages for dealing with data. Through this I met a lot of cool people, and every now and then we realized one or the other idea for a side project together. Some of these results can be found here on this page.
