# Biography

I am a business consultant at the business intelligence consultancy and Microsoft partner implexis analytics, where I am mainly responsible for data science applications. I mostly deal with complex problems regarding predictive analytics and artificial intelligence in the retail sector.

I am also a PhD candidate in the neuroradiology of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. My research interests include the applications of machine learning and pattern recognition in neurosciences, where I specialize on the prediction of the outcome of patients suffering from an ischemic stroke.

Since both positions require a big amount of technical expertise, I am focussing on higher programming languages, big data technologies and analytical toolchains, leading me -- almost randomly -- in all kind of different use cases and side projects.
