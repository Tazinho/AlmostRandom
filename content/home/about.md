Hi, welcome to my page about my personal Data Science projects.

In the past, I worked a lot in parallel in industry and research. This often involved gaining insights from smaller and larger data sets. So I spent a lot of time working on higher level programming languages and dealing with data. I also met a lot of cool people who were working on similar topics, and every now and then a neat idea for a side project came up. Some of these we have been able to realize and the results can be found here on this page.
